Despite being gendered, All of the deities in this mod lack biological gender and form and rather are identified by their percieved or emmitted feeling. They are unknowable, our brains simply fill in some blanks to reduce the strain of looking at the sun psychically so to speak.


Balance Pantheon:

Kiaescha, Peak of frozen strength, Depth of endless bounty, their power pulses gently yet firmly. Heralded by a great stag 4 meters high, it's bones of salt and fur of wet blood with eyes like a parent watching patiently.

Kigora, The endless cycle, The decisive fury, their power feels sharp to the touch but harmless to an honest heart. Heralded by a great sparrowhawk 4 meters high, it's feathers an illusion of hear and reflections and blinding light with eyes like a parent passing judgement.

Kichaochero, Her majesty yet unreachable horizons, their power feels as if it's shifting always out of reach. Heralded by a great serpent 4 meters high, it's scales of shattered glass and innards of wispy smoke with eyes like a parent watching in amusement.

Trinity of Fours, She who walks below in step, She who walks beneath in secret, She who walks above yet ahead, their power feels as if it comes from every reflection of you and shadow you cast. Heralded by a great panther 4 meters high, it's fur looks like rippling oil and nauseating secrets with eyes like a parent who already knows.


Chaos Pantheon:

the bound mother, a floating woman with tattered skin flaking away as if caught in a atomic blast underneath is barbed wire muscles wrapped around glass bones, her skin charred and papery. Thick, oily, blackend boat chains tether her to something unseen below the ground. Her eyes and modesty shielded by smoldering ribbons drapped across her frame flowing freely as if underwater. The duty-bound mother is conceptually the existential burden of womanhood at an intersection with knowledge and at odds with desire, the pain of childbirth and explosions of decay and beauty. A goddess of contracts.

maid Potentia, floating, dancing children who glow in blinding cool colors, their forms shifts between that of small prey animals and childhood toys but in the corner of your vision is always a child watching and waiting. Her power is yet to come, it flows around and through you dragging things forward toward what can be and way from what was. The maid Potentia is conceptually fleeting youth and collapsing waves of would be futures, her power can be felt strongest at nexsuses of potential fate such as big life decisions and around objects of random chance like dice and coins.

Consequence, when spoken to she prefers Automatia but can be invoked by either. Goddess of suits and cycles, witch of many forms, she appears as a normal adult woman matching your species and culture in casual states of dress. Upon revealing herself your hands begin multiplying, blooming at the wrist like flowers, and your face stretches towards the back of your head dividing and splitting, weeping and laughing, bickering with eachother and screaming. She is also the deity of existential burden and nexsuses of fate, alegedly.


Parasitic Pantheon:

Various deities and small gods that have latched onto and seeped through to our world, making thier presence known through a single object in which they attempt to extend their influence.

Inconsequentia, a lesser goddess from another world. Her power is felt through mundane tasks and meniality of chores. Not so much a parasite but very much an interloper at odds with what the other pantheons want. Is she feeding off bordem? Does she draw power from the very concept of quests? Who knows, shes here and she wants you to match all the socks you find in a nearby house.
