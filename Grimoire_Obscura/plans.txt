Note: this mod contains updated, repaired, and jury rigged versions of items and clothing from various other mods that are no longer maintained to my knowledge, 
if you see something in here that you created that you do not want to be in here please email me @ (staticsifting@gmail.com)

Note: there is a fair amount of erotic content included in this mod, not for shock value or perversion but because I believe that part of spirituality and spellwork is reclaiming sexuality and sensuality.
Being comfortable with your form and knowing your body is important for various parts of spellwork as far as I'm concerned. If it's really that problematic it will be sifted out into a patch in the future.

Fear not the maiden kiss nor the enchantress embrace, for through the mother strain bore the crone sway.

sew pockets into everything, ingest highly toxic homemade makeup and cosmetics, make beautiful gowns and decorate them with ribbons, lace, and delicate filigre

You can choose these titles as mutations or gain them ingame, then attune to more specific forms
Attunements are more neutral modifications that advance you in a specific direction reguardless of your chosen goddess.
Metamorph is a rare specialization that combines parts of all other classess, basically a master debug mode you probably shouldn't get

Crafting requires several stationary tools with specialized qualities:
Altar for making offerings, can be constructed out of a number of things you find including special rocks, bones, and magic items you find or make
Idol for prayer, each idol has its own quality of both prayer and devotion to a specific god, basically the more appropriate material it's made out of the easier it is to connect to that deity
Cauldron for brewing, just a big cooking pot you can light a fire under for making soups and potions
incense holders, little pots to contain incense, work like braisers but fancy
Drying lines, dreamcatchers, and yuna sifters are all constructions that are set up, and process like a smoking rack to collect various metaphysical ingredients for crafting
Tapistries require spinning wheels, looms, and a story to make and then can be constructed like a curtain, stories are gained from npcs and rarely from deconstructing special books
ritual kits are made from all the ingredients needed to complete the ritual and then deployed like a trap, they are used to ward areas or in construction
circle of rites, I want them to be big multi-tile layouts that do something interesting and let the players find uses for it, such as making light or acting like a barrier

Vehicle parts:
Engines: Sacred Heartstring, Wishing Prayer, Unwavering Promise, Endless Sky/Sea/Soil (one for each fueltype)
Fuel: goddess tears, skipped heartbeats, enchanted nectar
Batteries: mystic rose, inscribed skull (size matters), twitching poppet, various totems
Parts: enchanted wicker frames/aisles/boards/doors, saddlebags (motorcycles and brooms), whirlwind token (rotor), floatstone (rotor), fluttering poppet (rotor)

Poppets and Totems:
poppets made of corpses are used to mimic that creature for it's abilities or inflict one of it's attacks on another
totems are used to draw in spirits and fuel poppets, wands, and regalia

Idols:
Large idols of various ingame gods can be made and used to perform prayers, ask for guidance, and call a herald
each deity has a specific material that conducts their messages best, using anything else makes a lesser form of the idol. the second level of the quality is only given to the appropriate materials and required to ask for favors

Monsters:
various capricious fae to trade with or harvest from, approaching them properly is described ingame and the only way to get their resources

Stores:
ingame vending machines and interdimentional catalogs (like project kawaii) can be found but the means to use them must be made first.
The vending machine works like a squirrel trap and captures a random gobbul to operate it. they break over time and must be rebaited
animating dead critters such as birds and rabbits and sending them on errants with a symbolic token and receive something in return

Special Features:
transforming weapons and clothing magical girl style where they have simple light forms like ribbons or jewlery and can be activated to transform into their battle forms
random quests from gods and fae (the rewards are the books and knowledge you need to continue)
new tools and qualities and materials, such as lace, silk, and crocheting
lingerie and underwear expansion for maximum style and comfort and a source of valuble material

longterm delicate or time intensive tasks are used to build up mana and focus for spellwork, crafting takes a long time for things in this mod

enchanted wicker: difficult to prepare material for flying brooms and wands and staves, takes sticks or twigs and animal or tainted blood
yuna wool: fluffy thread pulled from the fabric of reality itself, perhaps evidence of string theory. this highly radioactive yarn needs to be carefully handled and is mainly obtained by sifting portal storms with a special construction
runic filigre: little puzzle pieces of precious metal that coldweld together into filigre cages capable of holding conceptual and metaphysical resources
temporal lace: less so lace and more remnants of memories woven into antique and well-loved clothing, more common in dresses and other pieces that have sentimental or strong memories soaked into them.
soakstone: porous stones, such as limestone, sandstone, marble, and granite, they have been shaped and engraved to soak up magical energies, songs, and memories
empowered bone: not just bone but stone and wood as well, the bones of animals, mountains, and forests make for excellent mediums of enforcing will upon the world

path of colors for witches
Green: mainly deals in herbs and potions, very little in the way of combat and armor stuff, the opposite of red and blue
White: only uses that which is freely given, some animal parts but mainly Green witch stuff and Blue witch stuff, the opposite of black
Black: works in human and tained blood, mainly makes weapons and armor and red witch stuff, the opposite of white in that they take rather than ask
Blue: mainly an artificer, makes a lot of utility gear and devices, the opposite of red and green
Red: does big spellwork and wardings, the opposite of blue and green
Gold: sun worshipper, works better in the day and with heat, opposite of Silver
Silver: moon worshipper, works better at night and with cold, opposite of Gold

Levels of hexstiching/seal ripping
lvl 1: small objects like clothing and tools
lvl 2: large objects like car parts and furniture
lvl 3: huge objects like walls and doors (seal portals with a giant sewing needle)

Giant weapons that mimic the smaller tools
huge sissors, needles, and various fiberworking tools
Big teaparty stuff like a spoon mace, a teacup helmet, a saucer buckler
staves have heavier effects than scepters which are stronger than wands but inversly wands are the most precise and staves are unwieldy with their effective spell sizes and fuel consumption
the fluffier and fancier the dress you wear the heavier it's protection but worse it's encumbrance, but some of them can be contained inside gemstones and such to only be deployed when fighting evil
more primal options that offer less protection but more utility, fun stuff like big skull hats and shoulder pads, scarification and tattooing that acts as unremovable clothing but give a sort of spiritual armor
witch and lolita dresses that are specialized for a specific situation like fire or radiation or being underground

work on the msx art pack after you have most of the stuff in game.
