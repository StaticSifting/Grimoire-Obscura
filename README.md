if you see something in here that you created that you do not want to be in here please email me (staticsifting@gmail.com)

There is a fair amount of potentially erotic content included in this mod, not for shock value or perversion but because I believe that part of spirituality and spellwork is reclaiming aspects of yourself and your awareness of physical form.
Being comfortable with and knowing your body is important for various parts of spellwork as far as I'm concerned. If it's really that problematic it will be sifted out into a patch in the future or wholely removed at some point. I promise I'm resonable.

If you see something in here you like, or want to add something missing, send me a message!
